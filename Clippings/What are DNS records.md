## DNS records

DNS records are sets of instructions that live on DNS servers. These instructions are vital to the success of a DNS lookup.

## What is a DNS record?

[DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) records (aka zone files) are instructions that live in authoritative [DNS servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/) and provide information about a domain including what [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain. These records consist of a series of text files written in what is known as DNS syntax. DNS syntax is just a string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a ‘ [TTL](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/) ’, which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how often a DNS server will refresh that record.

You can think of a set of DNS records like a business listing on Yelp. That listing will give you a bunch of useful information about a business such as their location, hours, services offered, etc. All domains are required to have at least a few essential DNS records for a user to be able to access their website using a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), and there are several optional records that serve additional purposes.

## What are the most common types of DNS record?

- **A record** - The record that holds the IP address of a domain. [Learn more about the A record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/)
- **AAAA record** - The record that contains the IPv6 address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which list the IPv4 address). [Learn more about the AAAA record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-aaaa-record/)
- **CNAME record** - Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address. [Learn more about the CNAME record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/)
- **MX record** - Directs mail to an email server. [Learn more about the MX record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-mx-record/)
- **TXT record** - Lets an admin store text notes in the record. These records are often used for email security. [Learn more about the TXT record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/)
- **NS record** - Stores the name server for a DNS entry. [Learn more about the NS record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/)
- **SOA record** - Stores admin information about a domain. [Learn more about the SOA record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-soa-record/)
- **SRV record** - Specifies a port for specific services. [Learn more about the SRV record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-srv-record/)
- **PTR record** - Provides a domain name in reverse-lookups. [Learn more about the PTR record.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/)

## What are some of the less commonly used DNS records?

- **AFSDB record** - This record is used for clients of the Andrew File System (AFS) developed by Carnegie Melon. The AFSDB record functions to find other AFS cells.
- **APL record** - The ‘address prefix list’ is an experiment record that specifies lists of address ranges.
- **CAA record** - This is the ‘certification authority authorization’ record, it allows domain owners state which certificate authorities can issue certificates for that domain. If no CAA record exists, then anyone can issue a certificate for the domain. These records are also inherited by subdomains.
- **DNSKEY record** - The ‘ [DNS Key Record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dnskey-ds-records/) ’ contains a [public key](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/) used to verify [Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-security/) signatures.
- **CDNSKEY record** - This is a child copy of the DNSKEY record, meant to be transferred to a parent.
- **CERT record** - The ‘certificate record’ stores public key certificates.
- **DCHID record** - The ‘DHCP Identifier’ stores info for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a standardized network protocol used on IP networks.
- **DNAME record** - The ‘delegation name’ record creates a domain alias, just like CNAME, but this alias will redirect all subdomains as well. For instance if the owner of ‘example.com’ bought the domain ‘website.net’ and gave it a DNAME record that points to ‘example.com’, then that pointer would also extend to ‘blog.website.net’ and any other subdomains.
- **HIP record** - This record uses ‘Host identity protocol’, a way to separate the roles of an IP address; this record is used most often in mobile computing.
- **IPSECKEY record** - The ‘IPSEC key’ record works with the [Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/), an end-to-end security protocol framework and part of the Internet Protocol Suite [(TCP/IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/).
- **LOC record** - The ‘location’ record contains geographical information for a domain in the form of longitude and latitude coordinates.
- **NAPTR record** - The ‘name authority pointer’ record can be combined with an [SRV record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-srv-record/) to dynamically create URI’s to point to based on a regular expression.
- **NSEC record** - The ‘next secure record’ is part of DNSSEC, and it’s used to prove that a requested DNS resource record does not exist.
- **RRSIG record** - The ‘resource record signature’ is a record to store digital signatures used to authenticate records in accordance with DNSSEC.
- **RP record** - This is the ‘responsible person’ record and it stores the email address of the person responsible for the domain.
- **SSHFP record** - This record stores the ‘SSH public key fingerprints’; SSH stands for Secure Shell and it’s a cryptographic networking protocol for secure communication over an unsecure network.
