## A Detailed Analysis of the KDD CUP 99 Data Set

##### Mahbod Tavallaee, Ebrahim Bagheri, Wei Lu, and Ali A. Ghorbani

Abstract— During the last decade, anomaly detection has  
attracted the attention of many researchers to overcome the  
weakness of signature-based IDSs in detecting novel attacks,  
and KDDCUP’99 is the mostly widely used data set for the  
evaluation of these systems. Having conducted an statistical  
analysis on this data set, we found two important issues which  
highly affects the performance of evaluated systems, and results  
in a very poor evaluation of anomaly detection approaches. To  
solve these issues, we have proposed a new data set, NSL-KDD,  
which consists of selected records of the complete KDD data  
set and does not suffer from any of mentioned shortcomings.

I. INTRODUCTION  
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage  
and the huge increase in the number of applications running  
on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly  
more important. As it is shown in \[1\], all the computer  
systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both  
technically difficult and economically costly to be solved by  
the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detec-  
tion Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect  
anomalies and attacks in the network, is becoming more  
important. The research in the intrusion detection field has  
been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misuse-based  
detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based  
detection is generally favored in commercial products due  
to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research  
anomaly detection is typically conceived as a more powerful  
method due to its theoretical potential for addressing novel  
attacks.  
Conducting a thorough analysis of the recent research  
trend in anomaly detection, one will encounter several ma-  
chine learning methods reported to have a very high detection  
rate of 98% while keeping the false alarm rate at 1% \[2\].  
However, when we look at the state of the art IDS solutions  
and commercial tools, there is no evidence of using anomaly  
detection approaches, and practitioners still think that it is  
an immature technology. To find the reason of this contrast,  
we studied the details of the research done in anomaly  
detection and considered various aspects such as learning  
and detection approaches, training data sets, testing data sets,  
and evaluation methods. Our study shows that there are some  
inherent problems in the KDDCUP’99 data set \[3\], which is  
widely used as one of the few publicly available data sets  
for network-based anomaly detection systems.

The first important deficiency in the KDD data set is the
huge number of redundant records. Analyzing KDD train and
test sets, we found that about 78% and 75% of the records
are duplicated in the train and test set, respectively. This
large amount of redundant records in the train set will cause
learning algorithms to be biased towards the more frequent
records, and thus prevent it from learning unfrequent records
which are usually more harmful to networks such as U2R
attacks. The existence of these repeated records in the test
set, on the other hand, will cause the evaluation results to be
biased by the methods which have better detection rates on
the frequent records.
In addition, to analyze the difficulty level of the records in
KDD data set, we employed 21 learned machines (7 learners,
each trained 3 times with different train sets) to label the
records of the entire KDD train and test sets, which provides
us with 21 predicted labels for each record. Surprisingly,
about 98% of the records in the train set and 86% of the
records in the test set were correctly classified with all the
21 learners. The reason we got these statistics on both KDD
train and test sets is that in many papers, random parts of
the KDD train set are used as test sets. As a result, they
achieve about 98% classification rate applying very simple
machine learning methods. Even applying the KDD test set
will result in having a minimum classification rate of 86%,
which makes the comparison of IDSs quite difficult since
they all vary in the range of 86% to 100%.
In this paper, we have provided a solution to solve the
two mentioned issues, resulting in new train and test sets
which consist of selected records of the complete KDD data
set. The provided data set does not suffer from any of the
mentioned problems. Furthermore, the number of records
in the train and test sets are reasonable. This advantage
makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete
set without the need to randomly select a small portion.
Consequently, evaluation results of different research work
will be consistent and comparable.
The new version of KDD data set, NSL-KDD is publicly
available for researchers through our website^1. Although, the
data set still suffers from some of the problems discussed
by McHugh [4] and may not be a perfect representative of
existing real networks, because of the lack of public data sets
for network-based IDSs, we believe it still can be applied as
an effective benchmark data set to help researchers compare
different intrusion detection methods.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the KDDCUP99 data set which is wildly used in
anomaly detection. In Section III, we first review the issues

in DARPA’98 and then discuss the possible existence of  
those problems in KDD’99. The statistical observations of  
the KDD data set will be explained in Section IV. Section  
V provides some solutions for the existing problems in the  
KDD data set. Finally, in Section VI we draw conclusion.

II. KDD CUP 99DATA SET DESCRIPTION  
Since 1999, KDD’99 \[3\] has been the most wildly used  
data set for the evaluation of anomaly detection methods.  
This data set is prepared by Stolfo et al. \[5\] and is built  
based on the data captured in DARPA’98 IDS evaluation  
program \[6\]. DARPA’98 is about 4 gigabytes of compressed  
raw (binary) tcpdump data of 7 weeks of network traffic,  
which can be processed into about 5 million connection  
records, each with about 100 bytes. The two weeks of  
test data have around 2 million connection records. KDD  
training dataset consists of approximately 4,900,000 single  
connection vectors each of which contains 41 features and  
is labeled as either normal or an attack, with exactly one  
specific attack type. The simulated attacks fall in one of the  
following four categories:

1. Denial of Service Attack (DoS): is an attack in  
	which the attacker makes some computing or memory  
	resource too busy or too full to handle legitimate re-  
	quests, or denies legitimate users access to a machine.
2. User to Root Attack (U2R):is a class of exploit in  
	which the attacker starts out with access to a normal  
	user account on the system (perhaps gained by sniffing  
	passwords, a dictionary attack, or social engineering)  
	and is able to exploit some vulnerability to gain root  
	access to the system.
3. Remote to Local Attack (R2L): occurs when an  
	attacker who has the ability to send packets to a  
	machine over a network but who does not have an  
	account on that machine exploits some vulnerability to  
	gain local access as a user of that machine.
4. Probing Attack:is an attempt to gather information  
	about a network of computers for the apparent purpose  
	of circumventing its security controls.  
	It is important to note that the test data is not from the same  
	probability distribution as the training data, and it includes  
	specific attack types not in the training data which make the  
	task more realistic. Some intrusion experts believe that most  
	novel attacks are variants of known attacks and the signature  
	of known attacks can be sufficient to catch novel variants.  
	The datasets contain a total number of 24 training attack  
	types, with an additional 14 types in the test data only. The  
	name and detail description of the training attack types are  
	listed in \[7\].  
	KDD’99 features can be classified into three groups:
5. Basic features: this category encapsulates all the  
	attributes that can be extracted from a TCP/IP con-  
	nection. Most of these features leading to an implicit  
	delay in detection.
6. Traffic features: this category includes features that  
	are computed with respect to a window interval and is
```
divided into two groups:
a) “same host” features: examine only the con-
nections in the past 2 seconds that have the same
destination host as the current connection, and
calculate statistics related to protocol behavior,
service, etc.
b) “same service” features: examine only the
connections in the past 2 seconds that have the
same service as the current connection.
The two aforementioned types of “traffic” features are
called time-based. However, there are several slow
probing attacks that scan the hosts (or ports) using a
much larger time interval than 2 seconds, for example,
one in every minute. As a result, these attacks do not
produce intrusion patterns with a time window of 2
seconds. To solve this problem, the “same host” and
“same service” features are re-calculated but based on
the connection window of 100 connections rather than
a time window of 2 seconds. These features are called
connection-based traffic features.
3) Content features:unlike most of the DoS and Probing
attacks, the R2L and U2R attacks don’t have any
intrusion frequent sequential patterns. This is because
the DoS and Probing attacks involve many connections
to some host(s) in a very short period of time; however
the R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in the data
portions of the packets, and normally involves only a
single connection. To detect these kinds of attacks, we
need some features to be able to look for suspicious be-
havior in the data portion, e.g., number of failed login
attempts. These features are called content features.
```

###### III. INHERENT PROBLEMS OFKDD’99DATA SET

```
As it is mentioned in the previous section, KDD’99 is built
based on the data captured in DARPA’98 which has been
criticized by McHugh [4], mainly because of the character-
istics of the synthetic data. As a result, some of the existing
problems in DARPA’98 remain in KDD’99. However, there
are some deliberate or unintentional improvements, along
with additional problems. In the following we first review the
issues in DARPA’98 and then discuss the possible existence
of those problems in KDD’99. Finally, we discuss new issues
observed in the KDD data set.
1) For the sake of privacy, the experiments chose to
synthesize both the background and the attack data,
and the data is claimed to be similar to that observed
during several month of sampling data from a number
of Air Force bases. However, neither analytical nor
experimental validation of the data’s false alarm char-
acteristics were undertaken. Furthermore, the workload
of the synthesized data does not seem to be similar to
the traffic in real networks.
2) Traffic collectors such as TCPdump, which is used in
DARPA’98, are very likely to become overloaded and
drop packets in heavy traffic load. However, there was
```

no examination to check the possibility of the dropped  
packets.

1. There is no exact definition of the attacks. For example,  
	probing is not necessarily an attack type unless the  
	number of iterations exceeds an specific threshold.  
	Similarly, a packet that causes a buffer overflow is not  
	always representative of an attack. Under such condi-  
	tions, there should be an agreement on the definitions  
	between the evaluator and evaluated. In DARPA’98,  
	however, there is no specific definitions of the network  
	attacks.  
	In addition, there are some critiques of attack taxonomies  
	and performance measures. However, these issues are not  
	of much interest in this paper since most of the anomaly  
	detection systems work with binary labels, i.e., anomalous  
	and normal, rather than identifying the detailed information  
	of the attacks. Besides, the performance measure applied  
	in DARPA’98 Evaluation, ROC Curves, has been widely  
	criticized, and since then many researchers have proposed  
	new measures to overcome the existing deficiencies \[8\], \[9\],  
	\[10\], \[11\], \[12\].  
	While McHugh’s critique was mainly based on the pro-  
	cedure to generate the data set rather than analysis of the  
	data, Mahoney and Chan \[13\] analyzed DARPA background  
	network traffic and found evidence of simulation artifacts  
	that could result in an overestimation of the performance of  
	some anomaly detection techniques. In their paper, authors  
	mentioned five types of anomalies leading to attack detection.  
	However, analysis of the attacks in the DARPA data set re-  
	vealed that many did not fit into any of these categories which  
	are likely caused by simulation artifacts. As an example, the  
	TTL (time to live) values of 126 and 253 appear only in  
	hostile traffic, whereas in most background traffic the value  
	is 127 and 254. Similarly, some attacks can be identified  
	by anomalous source IP addresses or anomalies in the TCP  
	window size field.  
	Fortunately the aforementioned simulation artifacts do not  
	affect the KDD data set since the 41 features used in KDD  
	are not related to any of the weaknesses mentioned in \[13\].  
	However, KDD suffers from additional problems not existing  
	in the DARPA data set.  
	In \[14\], Portnoy et al. partitioned the KDD data set into ten  
	subsets, each containing approximately 490,000 instances or  
	10% of the data. However, they observed that the distribution  
	of the attacks in the KDD data set is very uneven which  
	made cross-validation very difficult. Many of these subsets  
	contained instances of only a single type. For example, the  
	4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th, 10% portions of the full data set  
	contained onlysmurfattacks, and the data instances in the  
	8th subset were almost entirelyneptuneintrusions.  
	Similarly, same problem withsmurfandneptuneattacks  
	in the KDD training data set is reported in \[15\]. The authors  
	have mentioned two problems caused by including these  
	attacks in the data set. First, these two types of DoS attacks  
	constitute over 71% of the testing data set which completely  
	affects the evaluation. Secondly, since they generate large

volumes of traffic, they are easily detectable by other means
and there is no need of using anomaly detection systems to
find these attacks.
```
```
IV. STATISTICALOBSERVATIONS
As was mentioned earlier, there are some problems in the
KDD data set which cause the evaluation results on this
data set to be unreliable. In this section we perform a set
of experiments to show the existing deficiencies in KDD.
```
```
A. Redundant Records
One of the most important deficiencies in the KDD data set
is the huge number of redundant records, which causes the
learning algorithms to be biased towards the frequent records,
and thus prevent them from learning unfrequent records
which are usually more harmful to networks such as U2R
and R2L attacks. In addition, the existence of these repeated
records in the test set will cause the evaluation results to be
biased by the methods which have better detection rates on
the frequent records.
To solve this issue, we removed all the repeated records
in the entire KDD train and test set, and kept only one copy
of each record. Tables I and II illustrate the statistics of the
reduction of repeated records in the KDD train and test sets,
respectively.
While doing this process, we encountered two invalid
records in the KDD test set, number 136,489 and 136,497.
These two records contain an invalid value, ICMP, as their
servicefeature. Therefore, we removed them from the KDD
test set.
```
```
B. Level of Difficulty
The typical approach for performing anomaly detection
using the KDD data set is to employ a customized machine
learning algorithm to learn the general behavior of the data
set in order to be able to differentiate between normal and
malicious activities. For this purpose, the data set is divided
into test and training segments, where the learner is trained
using the training portion of the data set and is then evaluated
```

KDD data set records

for its efficiency on the test portion. Many researchers within  
the general field of machine learning have attempted to  
devise complex learners to optimize accuracy and detection  
rate over the KDD’99 data set. In a similar approach, we have  
selected seven widely used machine learning techniques,  
namely J48 decision tree learning \[16\], Naive Bayes \[17\],  
NBTree \[18\], Random Forest \[19\], Random Tree \[20\], Multi-  
layer Perceptron \[21\], and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
\[22\] from the Weka \[23\] collection to learn the overall  
behavior of the KDD’99 data set. For the experiments, we  
applied Weka’s default values as the input parameters of  
these methods.

Investigating the existing papers on the anomaly detection  
which have used the KDD data set, we found that there  
are two common approaches to apply KDD. In the first,  
KDD’99 training portion is employed for sampling both the  
train and test sets. However, in the second approach, the  
training samples are randomly collected from the KDD train  
set, while the samples for testing are arbitrarily selected from  
the KDD test set.

In order to perform our experiments, we randomly created  
three smaller subsets of the KDD train set each of which  
included fifty thousand records of information. Each of the  
learners where trained over the created train sets. We then  
employed the 21 learned machines (7 learners, each trained  
3 times) to label the records of the entire KDD train and test  
sets, which provides us with 21 predicated labels for each  
record. Further, we annotated each record of the data set with  
a#successfulPredictionvalue, which was initialized  
to zero. Now, since the KDD data set provides the correct la-  
bel for each record, we compared the predicated label of each  
record given by a specific learner with the actual label, where  
we incremented#successfulPredictionby one if a  
match was found. Through this process, we calculated the  
number of learners that were able to correctly label that given  
record. The highest value for#successfulPrediction  
is 21, which conveys the fact that all learners were able to  
correctly predict the label of that record. Figure 1 and 2  
illustrate the distribution of#successfulPrediction  
values for the KDD train and test sets, respectively.

It can be clearly seen from Figure 1 and 2 that 97.97%  
and 86.64% of the records in the KDD train and test sets  
have been correctly labeled by all 21 classifiers. The obvious  
observation from these figures is that the application of

typical learning machines to this data set would result in
high accuracy rates. This shows that evaluating methods on
the basis of accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate
on the KDD data set is not an appropriate option.
```
```
V. OURSOLUTION
To solve the issues mentioned in the previous section, we
first removed all the redundant records in both train and test
sets. Furthermore, to create a more challenging subset of
the KDD data set, we randomly sampled records from the
#successfulPredictionvalue groups shown in Figure
1 and 2 in such a way that the number of records selected
from each group is inversely proportional to the percentage
of records in the original #successfulPrediction
value groups. For instance, the number of records in the 0-
5 #successfulPredictionvalue group of the KDD
train set constitutes 0.04% of the original records, therefore,
99.96% of the records in this group are included in the
generated sample. Tables III and IV show the detailed
statistics of randomly selected records.

included 125,973 and 22,544 records, respectively. Further-  
more, one more test set was generated that did not include  
any of the records that had been correctly classified by all 21  
learners, KDDTest−^21, which incorporated 11,850 records.  
For experimental purposes, we employed the first 20% of  
the records in KDDTrain+as the train set, having trained  
the learning methods, we applied the learned models on  
three test sets, namely KDDTest (original KDD test set),  
KDDTest+and KDDTest−^21. The result of the evaluation  
of the learners on these data sets are shown in Figures 3, 4  
and 5, respectively.

```
As can be seen in Figure 3, the accuracy rate of the
```
```
classifiers on KDDTest is relatively high. This shows that
the original KDD test set is skewed and unproportionately
distributed, which makes it unsuitable for testing network-
based anomaly detection classifiers. The results of the accu-
racy and performance of learning machines on the KDD’
data set are hence unreliable and cannot be used as good
indicators of the ability of the classifier to serve as a
discriminative tool in network-based anomaly detection. On
the contrary, KDDTest+and KDDTest−^21 test set provide
more accurate information about the capability of the clas-
sifiers. As an example, classification of SVM on KDDTest
is 65.01% which is quite poor compared to other learning
```

approaches. However, SVM is the only learning technique  
whose performance is improved on KDDTest+. Analyzing  
both test sets, we found that SVM wrongly detects one of the  
most frequent records in KDDTest, which highly affects its  
detection performance. In contrast, in KDDTest+since this  
record is only occurred once, it does not have any effects on  
the classification rate of SVM, and provides better evaluation  
of learning methods.

VI. CONCLUDINGREMARKS  
In this paper, we statistically analyzed the entire KDD  
data set. The analysis showed that there are two important  
issues in the data set which highly affects the performance  
of evaluated systems, and results in a very poor evaluation of  
anomaly detection approaches. To solve these issues, we have  
proposed a new data set, NSL-KDD \[24\], which consists of  
selected records of the complete KDD data set. This data set  
is publicly available for researchers through our website and  
has the following advantages over the original KDD data set:

- It does not include redundant records in the train set, so  
	the classifiers will not be biased towards more frequent  
	records.
- There is no duplicate records in the proposed test sets;  
	therefore, the performance of the learners are not biased  
	by the methods which have better detection rates on the  
	frequent records.
- The number of selected records from each difficulty-  
	level group is inversely proportional to the percentage  
	of records in the original KDD data set. As a result, the  
	classification rates of distinct machine learning methods  
	vary in a wider range, which makes it more efficient  
	to have an accurate evaluation of different learning  
	techniques.
- The number of records in the train and test sets are  
	reasonable, which makes it affordable to run the exper-  
	iments on the complete set without the need to randomly  
	select a small portion. Consequently, evaluation results  
	of different research works will be consistent and com-  
	parable.  
	Although, the proposed data set still suffers from some  
	of the problems discussed by McHugh \[4\] and may not be  
	a perfect representative of existing real networks, because  
	of the lack of public data sets for network-based IDSs, we  
	believe it still can be applied as an effective benchmark data  
	set to help researchers compare different intrusion detection  
	methods.
